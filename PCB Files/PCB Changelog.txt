- v1.0
Initial version

- v1.1
Corrected the LM358P (U4) wrong connections, now the microphone pre-amp circuit works as intended.
Adjusted the pads footprint of NRF24L01 making it easier to solder and preventing solder bridges.
The SW1 switch NO terminal is no longer connected to USB power, this allows to turn off the board when charging.

- v1.2
Added a flexPCB connector on the edge of the board connected to the ICSP pins, making easier to program the ATMEGA328P.
The battery terminals footprint is now only on one side of the board, preventing accidental short-circuit on the bottom side.
Moved some components to allow more space for the LiPo battery.
Changed the values of components C7,C9 R5,R6, adjusting the values for filtering the audio output.
